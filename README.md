## Inspiration

Small businesses have suffered during COVID-19. Additionally, people are feeling more disconnected from their communities than ever before because the face-to-face community service has become unsafe.  
In reality, there are limited virtual interaction opportunities for users and small businesses. Therefore we decided to help small businesses thrive and connect people to their community by designing a mobile application with NCR's APIs.
## What it does
**The Giving App** allows the user to perform contactless opportunity to give back to the community. More specifically, **The Giving App** suggests donations being run by that business after users completing a transaction at a local business. By showing a milestone bar, the user feels a sense of achievement operationalized. Additionally, community crowdfunding can be advertised in a non-invasive way.

## How we built it
* ***NCR BSP API*** Technology:
   
   * Orders API
   * Selling API
   * Catalog API

* Integrated the Selling Configuration APIs in one single ***Restful API*** with ***Python Flask***

* Used ***NCR API*** to store and retrieve user information

* Prototyped the application using ***NCR Design Systems in Figma*** with ***Flutter***

* Attended the ui/ux design workshop and used ***Mural*** for our 
Ideas Brainstorm

## Challenges we ran into

* Come up the idea that help our communitiies and small bussiness

* Understad the functionality of NCR's APIs

* Set up HMAC authorization to make API call with python

* Customize Items and their Category of Selling API to fit our application

* Integrate multiple APIs in one API call to make donating process concise

* Transfer our UI design complished by NCR Design System Figma to Flutter application

* Make API calls in Flutter

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We came up the idea that build and implemted the project in such a short period. Although we met a lot of challenges and difficulties, finally we over came it by discussing in the group, searching online and consulting to the mentors. In the end each group member felt they gained a lot from the hackathon.   

Our application build the future by connecting small businesses to users and to the community. It can be generalized to organizations other than small businesses.

## What we learned

* NCR APIs and security using hashing

* Retrieving useful informations using NCR APIs

* Design and implement Restful API for a frontend application

* How different APIs can be used together to create an application

* UI/UX design insights, using Figma as engineers (not designers) to create a decent looking app

* Develop apps for multiple platforms with single codebase using Flutter

## What's next for The Giving App

* Add more functions in our app
* Beautify the UI of our app
* Pubish it so that it can truly help our communities and samll bussiness
* ...
